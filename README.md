# Mc-Skin-Averager
Custom API calls to download skins (unstable) and then average their pixels for interesting results; hastily written in Python.

Just keep running it until an "average.png" shows up. If Python gives errors about pixel indicies being out of range then you probably downloaded a legacy skin (like "Notch"'s or "Minecraft"'s skins). Just delete those names and it should work fine.
